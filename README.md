so this big dinosaur already has ai but the coder that worked for me had retired from it.your task is to give the ai new features,like if the player is seen by the dinosaur,its roaring animation will trigger,and when it turns around,so it dosent look weirdmake it turn around with the turning animation that the dinosaur has,and for the killing system for the dinosaur,So either make some code to work with the made ai (or edit the already made ai) so that when the player is attacked by the dinosaur the player ragdolls and gets swiped up from the dinosaurs mouth,so basically the players dead body would be toggled onto the jaw bone on the armature,and to please fix the dinosaur running at the person when its close to seeing it because its not going up to the player (originally it worked just well)
